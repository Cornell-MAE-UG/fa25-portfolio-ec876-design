As part of a class project, I had to design a glider for a competition of taking the longest time to cover 20m in distance. I had to first estimate the ideal angle of attack and lift coefficient from airfoil tools. After that, I was able to find the Reynolds number, Target airspeed, Mass, Tail Coefficient, etc... This is then turned into a CAD, turning into a real product.

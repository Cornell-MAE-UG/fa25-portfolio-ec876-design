For this project, I designed a competition glider optimized to achieve the maximum possible time to cover a 20-meter flight distance. The process began with aerodynamic analysis: I identified the ideal angle of attack and corresponding lift coefficient using airfoil performance tools. With these aerodynamic targets set, I calculated key flight parameters—including Reynolds number, required airspeed, total mass, and tail volume coefficients—to ensure stable, efficient flight. These analytical results were then translated into a full 3D CAD model, which served as the basis for manufacturing the final physical glider used in testing.

## Device Description

The device analyzed in this study is a electric coffee heater designed to heat water prior to actually making the coffee. It consists of a plastic outer housing, an electric heating element, and a tubes where the fluid flow through.

## Operating Principle

When the power is turned on, the machine converts electrical power into heat energy. This heat energy is conducted through the metal hot plate and transferred to the water through contact. There is no actual pump in this machine.

## Fluid Dynamics Considerations
Fluid motion in the coffee heater is driven by buoyancy rather than by a mechanical pump. When the water is heated, some of the fluid turns into small vapor bubbles. Vapor has a lower density than actualy water so it rises up the tube, explained by the hydrostatic equation. Fluid flow is fully explained by the difference in density of the 2 state of fluid.

In the tubes, there are also viscous forces that opposes the fluid as it rises through. These viscous forces can be modeled through the Darcy Weisbach equation, and are essential to the machine in order to slow the flow down in make sure there is ample time for the fluid to be heated up. To improve this machine even more, we can either increase the friction coefficient, increase the length of the tube, or decrease the diameter of the tube.

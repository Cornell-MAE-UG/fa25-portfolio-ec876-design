## Device Description

The device used in this analysis is an everyday electric pressure cooker. The device has an inner pot, a heating element, and valves. It allows for cooking of food and water at elevated pressures and temperatures.

## Operating Principle
When the pressure cooker is plugged into the wall, and turned on, eletric energy is turned into thermal energy. This energy is transferred into the food inside the pot, increasing temperature, leading to vapor formation and a corresponding rise in pressure governed by the saturation properties of water.

## Modeling

We can model this system as a closed system during the cooking phase. Assuming that kinetic energy and potential energy is neglible, this following equation holds true:

$$
E = m c \Delta T
$$


Because there is no work done, due to a rigid pot, Q must equal to the change in energy. This then simplifies to:

\[
E = m c \Delta T
\]

As temperature increases in the sealed container, internal pressure is governed by the saturation pressure of water at the corresponding temperature:

\[
P = P_{sat}(T)
\]

## Conclusion

All in all, the energy balance and saturation pressure–temperature relationship explain how a pressure cooker achieves higher cooking temperatures that reduce cooking time while maintaining liquid and phase heat transfer.

## Overview

This project models the human cardiovascular system as a dynamic, feedback-controlled system using tools from MAE 3260. We represent arterial pressure and heart rate using a Windkessel-based pressure model and a heart-rate regulation equation driven by autonomic feedback. The system is treated as a closed-loop control network in which the heart, arteries, and baroreflex work together to maintain stable blood pressure despite disturbances.

To investigate how diseases affect system performance, we modify model parameters corresponding to arterial compliance, peripheral resistance, pump effectiveness, and baroreflex gain. Conditions such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, and arrhythmias alter these parameters in physiologically meaningful ways. By analyzing changes in state responses, stability, and transient behavior, we demonstrate how cardiovascular diseases reduce the system’s ability to regulate pressure and maintain healthy operation.

## Results

### Windkessel Pressure Modeling
Using the 2-state Windkessel system, we modeled arterial pressure dynamics under the assumptions of lumped compliance, resistance, and blood inertia. The governing equations were converted to state-space form and simulated for normal and diseased physiological conditions. The healthy model showed a well-damped pressure response with stable convergence to its steady-state value.

### Heart-Rate Regulation Model
The heart-rate ODE was added to form a coupled cardiovascular system.  
The equation  
\[
\frac{dHR}{dt} = -\frac{HR}{\tau_{HR}} + \frac{HR_0}{\tau_{HR}}
+ \frac{K_b}{\tau_{HR}}(P_{\text{set}} - P_a)
+ \frac{1}{\tau_{HR}} u_p(t)
\]
captures baroreflex control, baseline heart rate, and external inputs such as pacemaker stimulation.  
Simulations showed smooth regulation in healthy conditions with quick return to equilibrium following disturbances.

### Disease Parameter Simulations
We explored how modifying key parameters alters system behavior:

- **Coronary Heart Disease:** Increased vascular resistance and reduced pump function produced slower recovery, reduced flow, and elevated pressure burden. Responses showed delayed settling and impaired damping.
- **Hypertension:** Lower arterial compliance and higher resistance elevated steady-state pressure and reduced the system’s ability to buffer pulsatile input. Pressure responses became sharper and more sensitive to inflow.
- **Arrhythmias:** Increased time constant \(\tau_{HR}\), reduced baroreflex gain \(K_b\), and added rhythm disturbances generated irregular oscillations in heart rate and weakened coupling between pressure and HR regulation.

Across all cases, disease moved system poles closer to instability, reduced damping ratio, and degraded disturbance rejection capability.

### Block-Diagram Interpretation

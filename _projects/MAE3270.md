## Overview
As part of MAE 3270, I designed and analyzed a cantilever-style torque-wrench beam that uses strain-gauge measurements to determine applied torque. The project included generating a full CAD model, selecting a material, predicting stresses and deflection under load, and validating results using finite element analysis (FEA).

## Results

### 1. CAD Model
Images of the final CAD model are included below. All key dimensions (length, width, thickness, gauge location, fillet radii, and drive interface geometry) are shown to communicate the final manufactured design.
L  = 16;       % length from drive to where load applied (inches)
h  = 0.5;     % width (in)
b  = 0.8;      % thickness (in)
c  = 1.0;      % distance from drive center to strain gauge center (in)

### 2. Material Selection and Properties
The torque wrench beam was designed using **M42 tool steel** due to its high strength, good fatigue resistance, and compatibility with bonded strain gauges. Relevant material properties used in analysis include:

- Young’s modulus: 32 Msi  
- Poisson’s ratio: 0.29  
- Ultimate tensile strength: 370 ksi  
- Fatigue strength (10⁶ cycles): 115 ksi  
- Fracture toughness: 15 ksi√in  

These properties were used to evaluate yielding, fatigue performance, and crack-growth safety margins.

### 3. Loading and Boundary Conditions (FEM Setup)
The torque wrench was modeled as a **cantilever beam**, fixed at the drive end. A point load was applied at the load arm to generate the equivalent design torque. Boundary conditions included:

- Fully fixed constraints at the square drive interface  
- Point load producing 600 in-lbf torque  
- Strain gauge locations modeled on the tension side of the beam  

A simplified diagram of the applied loads and constraints is shown below.

### 4. Normal Strain Contours (Gauge Direction)
FEA results show the normal strain distribution in the beam along the longitudinal axis. Strain values at the gauge location were extracted for sensitivity calculations and compared with analytical predictions.

### 6. Summary of FEM Results
Key numerical results from the simulation:

- Maximum normal stress: 574.64 ksi  
- Load-point deflection: 0.23952 in  
- Strain at gauge location: 527.57 microstrain

### 7. Torque Wrench Sensitivity (mV/V)
Using the strain from FEA and the properties of a full-bridge strain gauge setup, the calculated sensitivity is:

- Sensitivity: 1.06 mV/V at full-scale torque  
- Configuration: Full-bridge, axial-tension gauges  

This output determines the voltage-to-torque calibration used during testing.

---

### 8. Strain Gauge Selection
A **full-bridge configuration** was selected to maximize sensitivity and temperature compensation. Gauge type and dimensions:

- Gauge length: 3mm
- Grid width: 2mm 
- Resistance: 350 Ω
- Waterproof backing for durability  

The beam provides sufficient flat surface area at the gauge location to ensure proper bonding and clean strain transfer.

## Summary
This project integrated CAD modeling, analytical stress calculations, material selection, and FEM verification to produce a functional torque-measurement tool. The final design met the required safety factors for yielding, fatigue, and brittle fracture while delivering a clear and measurable strain output suitable for laboratory calibration.
